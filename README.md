## What is Couchfugee?
This is a grass-roots project to help refugees find a place to stay using the existing CouchSurfing.com platform.

#### Was this created by CouchSurfing.com?
No. We are not associated directly with couchsurfing.com, but rather we are collecting a list of CS users who are specifically interested in hosting refugees.  Unfortunately there is no "Refugees welcome" option on the CS profile page (yet... :-).
