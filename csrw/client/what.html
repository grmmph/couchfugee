		<h2>What is couchfugee?</h2>
		<p>The aim of couchfugee is bringing refugees and couchsurfing hosts together.</p>
		<p>Everybody knows already about the refugee crisis and the problems refugees have regarding accommodation and supplies in European refugee camps.</p>
		<p>Another big aspect is integration. Refugees are coming from another culture and sometimes have difficulties to integrate into a place with a completely different rules, traditions and language.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, the solution already exists for many years. It's called <a target="_blank" href="http://couchsurfing.com">Couchsurfing</a>. With Couchsurfing, people can stay with locals in every country on earth. </p>
		<p>Couchfugee is not just an accommodation solution, but also a way to help refugees to intgrate into the local culture, learn about the new country they've just arrived to and above all - make new friends.</p>
		<h5>How can I join?</h5>
		<p>You will need to first make your Couchsurfing profile public, then simply <a href="/add">register as a host</a> using the link in the top-left of this page.  Please read about <a href="/registration">registration and privacy</a> before signing up.</p>
		<h5>How can I help?</h5>
		<p>If you speak a foreign language, the biggest help right now would be translating this website. Have a look at our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/grmmph/couchfugee">github repository</a> for more details.</p>
