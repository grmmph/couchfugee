		<h2>What is couchfugee?</h2>
		<p>The aim of couchfugee is bringing refugees and couchsurfing hosts together.</p>
		<p>Everybody knows already about the refugee crisis and the problems refugees have regarding accommodation and supplies in European refugee camps.</p>
		<p>Another big aspect is integration. Refugees are coming from another culture and sometimes have difficulties to integrate into a place with a completely different rules, traditions and language.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, the solution already exists for many years. It's called <a target="_blank" href="http://couchsurfing.com">Couchsurfing</a>. With Couchsurfing, people can stay with locals in every country on earth. </p>
		<p>Couchfugee is not just an accommodation solution, but also a way to help refugees to intgrate into the local culture, learn about the new country they've just arrived to and above all - make new friends.</p>
