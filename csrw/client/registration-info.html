      <h5 id="profile-info">How is my CouchSurfing profile information accessed?</h5>
      <p>When you <a href="/add">register as a host</a>, we retrieve <a href="#what-information-is-kept">specific pieces of information</a> which you have made public on your couchsurfing.com profile.  We do not have access to any private information.  Registration cannot happen unless your profile is visible to non-members (see <a href="#register">instructions above</a>).</p>

      <h5 id="what-information-is-kept">What information is kept by this site?</h5>
      <p>
        We store a copy of the following items:
        <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Location of your couch</li>
          <li>Photo</li>
          <li>Number of CS references</li>
        </ul>
        All other information is ignored.
      </p>

      <h5>How is my information used?</h5>
      <p>We list you as a host for refugees on this website.  We do not use it for marketing, spamming you, etc.</p>

      <h5>Does my Couchsurfing profile need to remain public?</h5>
      <p>No. After you have added yourself to the list, you can then make it private again.</p>

      <h5>How can I change / update information that has changed after I registered?</h5>
      <p>We are <a href="https://github.com/grmmph/couchfugee/issues/3" target="_blank">working on a feature</a> to do this.</p>

      <h5>How can I remove my profile from this site?</h5>
      <p>We are <a href="https://github.com/grmmph/couchfugee/issues/2" target="_blank">working on a feature</a> to do this.<br>
      If you need more urgent removal, you can try sending an email to <code>grmmph</code> [at] <code>gmail</code> [dot] <code>com</code> with your account name.</p>
